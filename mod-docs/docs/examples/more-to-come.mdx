# More to Come

The provided examples are just a small sample of what's to come. I'm relying on you guys to help create good examples, coz even I don't know all the possibilities of ModScripting.

So if you have any interesting examples, please [create a Pull Request](https://github.com/EthanSK/Ye-Olde-Meme-Game-2-Public/pulls) by adding a new `.mdx` file with the example in this folder, and I'll add it and credit to you!

Happy Modding!
