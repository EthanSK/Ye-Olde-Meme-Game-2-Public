# Community

If you haven't already guessed it, this game is very community driven. It relies on you guys to be creative and build something sick, for both level and mods for levels.

So here's a rundown of how you can interact with the community and me for anything about the game

## Community Mods Panel

Add ModScripts from all published levels get uploaded to the Community Mods panel:

<DocsImage
  src={require("./img/community mods panel.png").default}
  width={1300}
/>

You can sort by popularity or date, filter by meme type, published level id, script title, and even bring out a secret panel from the top left to filter by script hash.

Script hash uniquely identifies a script. It prevents multiple of the exact same ModScript from being put in the Community Mods.

Because your code gets automatically shared to Community Mods, you should think about keeping your code clean understandable for other developers.

## Discord

Discord is probably of the best ways to interact with the community. here is the invite link: [https://discord.com/invite/HmkcGRMZGc](https://discord.com/invite/HmkcGRMZGc)

This is chill place to vibelax and talk Ye Olde Meme Game 2. There are lots of appropriate channels to discuss things, including one for modding.

## Reddit

Reddit is where you can publicly find and create community YOMG2 related posts relating to the game and ModScripts.

Use at as you would any other subreddit.

Here is the link: [https://www.reddit.com/r/YeOldeMemeGame2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/YeOldeMemeGame2/)

## GitHub

To report bugs and submit feature requests, and see and interact with all those created by the community, use the public GitHub repo: <a target="_blank" href={publicTrackerUrl}>{publicTrackerUrl}</a>

## Stack Overflow

Now if you prefer an old-fashioned approach to developing, you can use Stack Overflow to ask questions about the game, using the `ye-olde-meme-game-2` [tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ye-olde-meme-game-2)

## REEEthan

I have a YouTube channel where I livestream and make videos showing the development of Ye Olde meme Game 2.
