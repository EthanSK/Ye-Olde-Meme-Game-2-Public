# Events

Events are a type of member on a C# class. You can subscribe to events in your ModScript to execute code in reaction to something happening.

Your event handler needs to have 2 parameters:

1. `sender` - The C# object that raised the event
2. `eventArgs` - An object that sometimes contains information about the event

## Subscribing to Events

To subscribe to an event, you need to first define the event handler function that runs in response to the event triggering:

```lua {8,15}
registerType("HealthChangedEventArgs")
registerType("IHasHealth")
registerType("Player")
registerType("Vector3")

local healthComponent = getCurrentItem().GetComponent("IHasHealth")

function healthChangedHandler(sender, eventArgs)
    local scale = healthComponent.transform.localScale
    local healthDecrease = eventArgs.OldHealth - eventArgs.NewHealth
    scale.x = scale.x + (0.069 * healthDecrease * Mathf.Sign(scale.x)) -- if scale is negative (coz item is facing other direction), we gotta subtract to make it wider
    healthComponent.transform.localScale = scale -- make size wider every time health changes. lol.
end

healthComponent.HealthChanged.add(healthChangedHandler)
-- REMEMBER TO UNSUBSCRIBE!!!! (see below)
```

:::note
You can only subscribe to events that match the standard EventHandler pattern (which is the case for all YOMG2 code), and meet [MoonSharp's event requirements](https://www.moonsharp.org/objects.html#events)

## Unsubscribing from Events

It is extremely important you unsubscribe from all events you've subscribed to. Usually, you would do this when exiting the level, which is when the [`cleanup`](/docs/guides/lifecycle-events#cleanup) function is called, but you can do this whenever:

```lua {3}
-- ...code from above
function cleanup()
    healthComponent.HealthChanged.remove(healthChangedHandler)
end
```
