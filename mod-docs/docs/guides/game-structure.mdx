# Game Structure

## Unity's Structure

First, a little bit about how the game engine works.

In Unity, everything in the scene is a `GameObject`. These GameObjects have a bunch of `Components` that give it a specific behaviour, like movement, collisions, attacking, etc.

A `Component` is defined by a C# class. A class is basically a collection of data (`member variables`), and functions (`member methods`) that acts on and modifies the data. So for example, in the [basic example](/docs/getting-started/basic-example), you saw the `gravityScale` member variable of the `Rigidbody2D` Component being used.

In the Unity Editor UI, here's what it would look like to set the value of the `gravityScale` member variable on the `RigidBody2D` Component attached to the `Player` GameObject.

<DocsImage
  src={require("./img/rigidbody on player example.png").default}
  width={800}
/>

<br />

And then, an example of a `method` you might call (in C#) on this `RigidBody2D` Component could be:

```csharp
playerRigidbody.AddForce(new Vector2(69, 420))
```

`GameObjects` can be nested under each other as children, so for example there might be a `Right Leg` child GameObject is under the root `Player` GameObject:

<DocsImage
  src={require("./img/unity gameobject hierarchy example.png").default}
  width={400}
/>

Which means the `Right Leg` position, rotation, and size will be based on the `Player` parent.

That's pretty much it for the fundamentals of how Unity works.

## Meme Game Structure

OK, so that's Unity. But how about Meme Game? Well, Ye Olde Meme Game 2 basically adds a thin layer on top of Unity. And that layer is `MemeItems`.

In your level that you build, there's a a bunch of `MemeItems` to choose from and place around, e.g. `Memeorang Man`, `Ohio`, `John Xina`, `Stonks`.

Whenever you create a `ModScript`, it will be added to a `MemeItem` that's placed in your level.

Each `MemeItem` in your level is made of a `root` GameObject, and potentially some `child` GameObjects.

And that's kinda it. Just so you know, behind the scenes, each `MemeItem` has a `MemeItem` Component that I made, as well as some other specific Components that causes the `MemeItem` to behave like it does, but you'll figure all that out by playing around.

## Conclusion

So, the way the ModScript system glues `Unity` and `MemeItems`together is by letting you access any `MemeItem`in the level, get any parent or child `GameObject`on that `MemeItem`, then get any `Component`on that `GameObject`. Now you can interact with any member variable or method on that `Component`, reading or writing its data, calling methods, reacting to events, and more.

Now with that said, let's take a look at the API Reference, which should help you visualize all this better.
