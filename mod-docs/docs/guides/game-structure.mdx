# Game Structure

## Unity's Structure

First, a little bit about how the Unity game engine works.

In Unity, everything in the scene is a `GameObject`.

These GameObjects have a bunch of `Components` that give it a specific behaviour, like movement, collisions, attacking, etc.

A `Component` is essentially a C# class.

A class is basically a collection of data (`member variables`), and functions (`member methods`) that acts on and modifies that data.

So for example, in the [basic example](/docs/getting-started/basic-example), you saw the `gravityScale` member variable of the `Rigidbody2D` Component being used.

In the Unity Editor UI, here's what it would look like to set the value of the `gravityScale` `member variable` on the `RigidBody2D` Component attached to the `Player` GameObject.

<DocsImage
  src={require("./img/rigidbody on player example.png").default}
  width={800}
/>

<br />

For `member methods`, an example of something you might call (in C#) on this `RigidBody2D` Component might be:

```csharp
playerRigidbody.AddForce(new Vector2(69, 420))
```

Also, `GameObjects` can be nested under each other as children, so for example there might be a `Right Leg` child GameObject under the root `Player` GameObject:

<DocsImage
  src={require("./img/unity gameobject hierarchy example.png").default}
  width={400}
/>

Which means the GameObject named `Right Leg` will have its position, rotation, and size be based on the `Player` GameObject.

That's pretty much it for the fundamentals of how Unity works.

## Meme Game Structure

OK, so that's Unity. But how about Ye Olde Meme Game 2? Well, YOMG2 basically adds a thin layer on top of Unity. And that layer is `MemeItems`.

In your level that you build, you add a bunch of `MemeItems` to it, e.g. `Memeorang Man`, `Ohio`, `John Xina`, or `Stonks`.

Whenever you create a `ModScript`, it must be added to a `MemeItem` that's in your level.

Each `MemeItem` in your level consists of a root GameObject, and sometimes some child GameObjects.

And that's kinda it. Just so you know, behind the scenes, each MemeItem has a `MemeItem` Component that I made, as well as some other specific Components that causes the MemeItem to behave like it does, but you'll figure all that out by playing around with modding and reading these docs.

## The glue between UNity and MemeItems

The way the modding system glues `Unity` and `MemeItems` together is as follows:

From your ModScript, you retrieve some `MemeItem` in the level, then access some parent or child `GameObject` on that `MemeItem`, then access any `Component` on that `GameObject`.

Now you can interact with any `member variable` or `method` on that `Component`.

<br />

Now with that said, let's take a look at the API Reference, which should help you visualize all this better.
