# Publishing

Once you've verified your modded level works in "Play Created Level" mode, you'll want to publish it. A level with mods has some slight differences with regards to how it's treated in the yes of the end-user (player) of you level.

## End-User differences

When you publish a level with ModScripts, it will show up in "Browse Published Levels" with a blue ModScript icon over the experimental mode enabled icon.

<DocsImage
  src={require("./img/level preview with mod.png").default}
  width={350}
/>

<br />

Then, just before a player plays or copies the level to edit, they will see this
warning message:

<DocsImage src={require("./img/mods warning modal.png").default} width={800} />

## Browse Published Level

There is a option to filter out levels with mods in them in the "Browse Published Levels" page. This is off by default. Think about that.

## Win verification

When a player wins a normal un-modded level, the server usually performs verification checks to make sure the player didn't cheat. These checks are turned off for modded levels.
