# Getting Items

How do you actually connect your ModScript to a MemeItem? You use one of these functions:

## Get Current Item

To get the MememItem that the ModScript is attached to, you can use the `getCurrentItem` function in your script:

```lua {1}
local datBoi = getCurrentItem()

local datBoiSpriteRenderer = datBoi.GetComponent("SpriteRenderer")
registerType("SpriteRenderer")
datBoiSpriteRenderer.flipX = true
```

`getCurrentItem` returns the `GameObject` of the MemeItem.

## Get Item By ID

There are times where you might want a ModScript to access _another_ MemeItem. This is done by using `getItemById` and passing the ID.

```lua {1}
local chargeTheyPhone = getItemById("AllTheyKnowIsChargeTheyPhone-388114-933a")

local chargeTheyPhoneText = chargeTheyPhone.GetComponent("TMPro.TMP_Text")
registerType("TMPro.TMP_Text") -- TextMeshPro is weird, u gotta register like this. TMP_Text is the base type of all TextMeshPro components, apply similar logic to other erroring things in the future ig.
chargeTheyPhoneText.text = "reeeeeeepeeepeeepoopoo."
```

So every MemeItem in the level has a unique ID, and you can copy that ID by pressing the copy icon next to the ID at the top of the Level Builder UI:

<DocsImage src={require("./img/copy ID example.png").default} width={400} />

## Get Items By Type

There may also be times where you want to do something to multiple MemeItems of a certain type. You can do this by using the `getItemsByType` function and passing the `MemeId`, since "type" in this context just refers to what MemeItem it is:

```lua {1}
local chads = getItemsByType("Chad")

for i, chad in ipairs(chads) do
    local chadArm = chad.transform.Find("Chad/bone_1/bone_2/bone_11") -- transform is a special type that comes pre-registered so you don't have to :0
    chadArm.transform.localScale = chadArm.transform.localScale * 0.420
end
```

`getItemsByType` returns a List (auto-converted to a Lua table) of all the MemeItems in your level that match that type. You can loop through and filter them and do as you please.

:::tip
To keep a nice smooth framerate for the players of your level, it is important you cache as much as you can. Caching just means storing the result of an operation so it doesn't have to recalculate every time if it doesn't need to. Just store the result of getting an item into a variable, as shown above. More is discussed in the [performance](/docs/guides/performance#caching) section.
