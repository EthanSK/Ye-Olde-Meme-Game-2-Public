# Static Types

The way Moonsharp handles static members in a type is by providing access through an _instance_ of the type. Kinda weird, outta my control.

This means you'll have to create an instance just to access the static member.

And if you were paying attention in the section about [constructors](/docs/guides/constructors), you'll remember that you cannot construct an arbitrary reference type (class) from your ModScript.

So, I've manually gone and added some instances of important types containing static members that are used commonly used when coding a game in Unity:

## Special Types

### Time

`Time` contains a lot of useful static members for dealing with in-game global time related variables, such as `Time.deltaTime` for the amount of time passed since the last frame, the `Time.timeScale` to for how much slow-mo or speed-up there is, and a lot more (read the Unity [Time docs](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Time.html))

For example:

```lua {4}
local timeGoneBy = 0

function update()
    timeGoneBy = timeGoneBy + Time.deltaTime -- you could also just use Time.time for all this but this is a pedantic example.
end
```

### UnityObject

`UnityEngine.Object` (exposed as `UnityObject`) contains three important categories of static members: `Instantiate`, `Destroy`, and `FindXXX` methods.

For example:

```lua {6}
local existingFlappy = getItemsByMemeId("FlappyBird")[1] -- requires flappy bird already in the level
local dummyQuaternion = createInstance("Quaternion")
local posOffset = createInstance("Vector3")
posOffset.x, posOffset.y = 2, 1

local flappyClone = UnityObject.Instantiate(
    existingFlappy,
    getItemsByMemeId("MemeorangMan")[1].transform.position + posOffset,
    dummyQuaternion.identity, -- looky here, it's using a static member! (more on this later)
    existingFlappy.transform.parent)
```

Here's another noteworthy example:

```lua {3}
registerType("EnemyMovementController")

local enemyMovementControllers = UnityObject.FindObjectsByType(getType("EnemyMovementController"), 0);

for idx, enemyMovCtrl in ipairs(enemyMovementControllers) do
    print(enemyMovCtrl.MoveForce)
    enemyMovCtrl.MoveForce = 0 -- make all enemies not move
end
```

<details>
  <summary>resolveAsActualType</summary>

You may have noticed the use of `resolveAsActualType`. This is a little helper that internally just returns the type as a `System.Object`, to trick MoonSharp into resolving the type as the most derived type it can possibly be. Because here, `UnityObject.FindObjectsOfType`'s C# return type is `UnityEngine.Object[]`, even though the actual underlying type in memory is `EnemyMovementController[]`, which is the thing we want to use in the for loop. Otherwise, without it, you would get an error trying to access `MoveForce`.

### Physics2D

`Physics2D` contains a lot of useful static members for dealing with 2D physics as well. For example:

```lua {10}
registerType('Player')
registerType('PlayerInfo')
registerType('ContactPoint2D')

local player = getCurrentItem().GetComponent('Player')
local playerLeftFootCol = player.Info.LeftFootCollider
local contacts = createCollection('System.Collections.Generic.List`1[[UnityEngine.ContactPoint2D, UnityEngine]]')

function getPlayerLeftFootContacts(collider)
    Physics2D.GetContacts(collider, contacts)
    print("Number of contacts: ", contacts.Count)
    return contacts
end

invokeAfterTime(1, getPlayerLeftFootContacts, {playerLeftFootCol})
```

### Mathf

Another useful bad boy, `Mathf` exposes some static arithmetic members, such as

```lua {1}
local leCalculation = Mathf.Atan2(420, 69)
print("le calc ", leCalculation)
```

## Static Members

Ok, that was the explanation of static members on reference types that you aren't normally able to construct or gain a reference to. I constructed them for you ðŸ¥¹.

Now how about static members on types you _are_ able to use in your ModScripts?

Well, you'll need an instance of the type to access them from, just like before. You can either [create the instance](/docs/guides/constructors) yourself if the type is a struct, or you'll need to get an instance using something like `GetComponent`

```lua {7}
local dummyVector2 = createInstance("Vector2")
local pointA, pointB = createInstance("Vector2"), createInstance("Vector2")

pointA.x, pointA.y = 6, 9
pointB.x, pointB.y = 4, 2

local distance = dummyVector2.Distance(pointA, pointB) -- normally accessed as Vector2.Distance in C# Unity
print("distance: ", distance)
```

So yeah.
