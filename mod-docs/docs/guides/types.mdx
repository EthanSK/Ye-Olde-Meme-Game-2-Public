# Types

Lua doesn't have a concept of types. But C# heavily relies on it. So we somehow need to bridge the gap.

## Register Type

If you want to use a member of some Component, you will first need to register the Component's type. This is done by calling the `registerType` function, and passing the type name as an argument.

For example, doing this will allow your script to use members of the `Rigidbody2D` Component:

```lua
registerType("Rigidbody2D")
```

`registerType` should be the first thing to check you haven't forgetten if you get an error.
And don't worry, it's ok if you register the type more than you need, you're not gonna get 'rona.

:::tip

You can register nested types by using '+'

```lua
registerType("EventsForModScript+Collision2DEventArgs")
```

:::

Usually, if you've forgotten to register a type, you'll get an error like this:

```
ScriptRuntimeException: cannot access field X of userdata<UnityEngine.Object>
```

or like this

```
ScriptRuntimeException: cannot convert clr type HealthChangedEventArgs
```

or maybe something else idk. But just always make sure you've registered the type before going down a rabbit hole of debugging.

:::info

If the type is not a YOMG2 type, or is not directly under the `UnityEngine` namespace, you have to provide the full namespace path, for example:

```lua
registerType("UnityEngine.U2D.Spline")
```

## Get Type

The `getType` function is used to get a C# type for a given type name. Funnily enough, it's actually used by `registerType` under the hood. It's useful in a few scenarios.

Sometimes, when you are using some methods from, say, a `Unity Engine` Component, it expects a type as an argument.

Take this for example. This is how you'd normally add a new Component to a GameObject when coding a game in C#.

```csharp
gameObject.AddComponent(typeof(Light2D));
```

The `AddComponent` method you see here is also available for you to use in your ModScript. But notice how it takes a C# type as an argument.

Well in Lua, there are no types, so you wouldn't be able to call this method.

So I added a `getType` function that basically does the same thing. In your ModScript, you can do something like this:

```lua
gameObject.AddComponent(getType("UnityEngine.Rendering.Universal.Light2D"))
```

:::note
Type names use the class or struct name, not the C# type name. For example, a float is a `System.Single`, an int is a `System.Int32`, and a string is a `System.String`, etc.
:::

## Whitelist

For users safety, there is a whitelist that dictates what types you can use in your ModScripts

<Whitelist />
<br />

Overall, this is a very generous allowance, and should allow you to do pretty much anything you want. But if not, submit a <a target="_blank" href={featureRequestUrl}>feature request</a> and I'll try my _very best_ to add it.

It would be nice to just allow everything in a perfect world, but we need these limitations is in place for [security reasons](/docs/guides/safety-and-security).

:::tip
Make sure you look [Unity documentation](https://docs.unity.com/) whenever you want more information about a type (class/struct). They have very good docs and examples.
