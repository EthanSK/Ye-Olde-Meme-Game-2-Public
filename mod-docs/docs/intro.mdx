# Introduction

I was about to release my game, then I had an epiphany and realised I should add modding support, so I began that journey, and then accidentally went _way_ too deep, as I always do. I do love feature creep. But here we are. And in hindsight, now that it's done, i'm _so glad_ I decided to do it, modding in Ye Olde Meme Game 2 is insane.

Ye Olde Meme Game 2 (YOMG2) is a 2D platform game where everything is a meme. Not only is there a Campaign mode with a story and lore, but there is an entire Level Builder where you can make your own levels and share them with the world - kinda like Mario Maker. But with memes. And better.

The Level Builder has an "experimental mode" option that gives you way more freedom to design your levels, including the ability to write code to manipulate pretty much everything in the game. I call it "ModScripting", and this documentation aims to teach you everything about it.

My approach to ModScripting is to give you as much freedom as possible by exposing all the code in the Unity Game Engine, and in Meme Game, while providing limitations only for the [safety and security](/docs/guides/safety-and-security) of players.

So with that in mind, I haven't been able to test every little thing since there are so many possibilites, so i'm relying on you to help build a strong modding [community](/docs/guides/community).
