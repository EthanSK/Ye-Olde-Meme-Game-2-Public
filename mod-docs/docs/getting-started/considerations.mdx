# Considerations

Before you go ahead and start creating mods, here are a few important things to consider:

- I'm trying to give you as much freedom to do whatever you want as possible. There is obviously a lot of room for abuse, so it's your responsibility to make sure your level plays well, and is a fun experience for other players.

- If ur a n00b, you'll probably find it very useful to interact with the [community](/docs/guides/community) and use Community Mods as a starting point.

- I strongly recommend you go through the tutorial in order, I reckon you'll become a modding _beast_ by the end of it (and plus I spent a lot of time curating these docs).

Go crazy.

Go stupid.

Ah.
